Assume we have a 3 node (a,b,c) graph in the form of a triangle:

(a,b) = -3
(b,c) = -3
(a,c) = -5

So from here we see that a->b->c is the shortest path now lets add
a positive constant

(a,b) = -3 + 3 = 0
(b,c) = -3 + 3 = 0
(a,c) = -5 + 3 = -2

So now the direct path has less cost but that path originaly costs -5
which is worst then -6 which is the optimal path.

Adding a constant distorts the algorithm relative order.
