In the average case (assuming a balanced distribution), the total work is O(d Â· n).
In the worst-case scenario, if the distribution is extremely skewed, the recurrence could worsen; however, for a typical case with fixed d, the time complexity is O(n).
The total extra space required is O(n + R) (with R being constant relative to n in many cases), which is O(n).
