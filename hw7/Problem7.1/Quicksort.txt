After implementing all the quicksort versions and running all of them it came up with these results:

Average time (Lomuto): 0.000146004 seconds
Average time (Hoare): 0.000131962 seconds
Average time (Median-of-three): 0.000146785 seconds

Hoare's Partition Algorithm is generally faster than because it 
performs fewer swaps and makes only one traversal of the array, 
leading to better time complexity in practice.

Implemented a Bar chart in Quicksortplot.py
